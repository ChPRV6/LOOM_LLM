The uploads section is where we will provide our respective input images. Once the images have been uploaded, we can use them as test images for our analysis.
User Interaction via Web Form:

HTML Form: Users upload images through the form, which are then sent to the server.
Asynchronous Processing and Response Handling:

JavaScript: Handles the form submission asynchronously using the fetch API, allowing for a smooth user experience.
Server-Side Processing with AI Integration:

File Handling: The server receives the files, saves them, and validates them.

Integration with ChatGPT for Analysis:

After saving the files, the server could send the images (or metadata about the images) to ChatGPT or another AI model via an API call.
Classification or Analysis: ChatGPT or a specialized model could analyze the images to classify features, extract relevant information, or provide more detailed instructions based on the image content.
AI Response: The AI model processes the image data and returns results or classifications. For instance, ChatGPT could be used to generate natural language descriptions or instructions based on the content of the images.
Generate and Send Results:

The server combines the AI-generated results with any additional processing or mock data and formats it into a JSON response.
Result Presentation:

Dynamic Content Updates: The client-side JavaScript receives the results from the server and dynamically updates the page. This includes displaying the image with the AI-generated analysis or instructions.
How to Integrate ChatGPT:
Prepare the Request:

Once the images are saved on the server, prepare a request to send the image data or relevant information to ChatGPT. You might need to convert the image to a format suitable for the AI model, such as extracting features or using image metadata.
Call ChatGPT API:

Make an API call to ChatGPT or another relevant service, sending the image data or metadata. The request should be structured according to the API's requirements.
Process AI Response:

Receive the AI-generated response, which could include feature classifications, descriptions, or detailed instructions based on the image content.
Combine and Format Results:

Combine the AI-generated information with any additional processing results. Format this data into a JSON response that includes filenames, features, and testing instructions.
Update Front-End:

Send the JSON response back to the front-end and use JavaScript to dynamically display the results.
